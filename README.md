# dataGazer-go
A RAD data (mostly for visualization) framework that a person can build in days instead of months, alternative implementation

## early description:
Same as of Ruby implementation but\
instead of Active Record for sqlite (mature), https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/go (mature)\
instead TTY prompt (production ready), bubbletea (tend to think is prod. ready)\
instead `eval()` string parsing with injection defences, I might use: a full DSL, reflection (although I don't think it's sufficient to solve the problem), or an embedded LUA machine\
\
*let the race begin*
